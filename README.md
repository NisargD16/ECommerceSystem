# ECommerceSystem in Java

In this project, I created an e-commerce system in Java. It has similar features as an average e-commerce system like Amazon or eBay. With implemented concepts like inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, exception handling, Object-Oriented Programming, etc., this e-commerce system successfully performs various functionalities. You can order products, cancel orders, check the list of customers and the products that they ordered, add items to cart, remove items from cart and a few others. This project contains various different classes for defining different types of objects such as books, shoes, and a general product.
